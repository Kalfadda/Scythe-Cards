of Unity's Scriptable Object Workflow to allow game developers to add
accessibility options quickly, easily and fast.

Instructions:

Simply drop the Subtitle Manager prefab into your scene, create a subtitle card, reference it, call the method and it's done!

It's easily accomplished via the prefabbed manager, a scriptable object that contains your dialogue and timing, and just calling the method.
For a full explanation please see the barebones 'Example Scene' and review the code and tooltips to understand better.
