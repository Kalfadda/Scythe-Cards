Scythe Cards is a simple and barebones subtitle system that takes advantage
of Unity's Scriptable Object Workflow to allow game developers to add
accessibility options quickly, easily and fast.

Requirements:
- <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/working-with-textmesh-pro#5f86410eedbc2a00249a4927">TextMesh Pro</a>

Instructions:
- Extract the Unity Package into your game
- Simply drop the Subtitle Manager prefab into your scene, create a subtitle card, reference it, call the method and it's done!

The entire system is easily accomplished via the prefabbed manager, a scriptable object that contains your dialogue and timing, and just calling the method.
For a full explanation please see the barebones 'Example Scene' and review the code and tooltips to understand better.
